## Description

I manged to make all 3 files mobile responsive, I will say this was a bit of a challenge for me but im happy with the result. All links on the nav bar work along with the toggler button. Also I added some links to my personal social media accounts. I left the portfolio images blank cause I really didnt have any work of my own to show since Im still pretty new, but I plan to keep this repo for the future and add images of my work.
