## Description

I've updated every page and added buttons that link to my Github Linkedin and a PDF of my Resume. I also made major changes to the home page which has clickable links too all the different pages. I added som,e personal information to my 'Contact' page along wiht adjustiong the contact form. The final touch is I decied to switch to a lighter layout vs the black and dark layoput I set up previously, which I think looks a lot better!
